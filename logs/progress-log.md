### [2024-12-13]
**Summary:** Initial project setup and planning.

**Details:**
- Created the project repository on GitHub.
- Defined the project structure and documentation layout.
- Outlined the initial goals.

**Next Steps:**
- [x] Research CPU basics and memory requirements.

---

**Summary:** Completed research on CPU architecture and memory requirements.

**Details:**
- Researched **16-bit processor architecture** and **basic memory configurations**.
- Found that the **16-bit address bus** limits the processor to **64KB** of RAM, and identified techniques for **memory expansion** using paging or bank switching.
- Explored various design choices for **ALU**, **control unit**, and **registers**.

**Next Steps:**
- [x] Finalize design decisions on **CPU architecture**.
- [ ] Start outlining the first draft of the **processor's instruction set**.

---

**Summary:** Finalized CPU design decisions and updated project documentation.

**Details:**
- Made final decisions on **CPU architecture** (16-bit data bus, 16-bit address bus, 8 general-purpose registers).
- Updated the **README** with **CPU specifications** and **RAM limitations**.
- Decided on using **breadboards** for initial prototyping.

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Begin creating the first **Logisim Evolution** simulation of the **CPU**.
- [ ] Research more on the **ALU** design and its integration with the control unit.
