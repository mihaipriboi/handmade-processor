**Decision:** Use breadboards instead of prototype boards for first hardware assembly prototype.

**Reasoning:**
- Provides flexibility for testing and prototyping.
- Facilitates quick modifications and component replacements.
- Faster to assemble and disassemble for iterative development.
- Allows hands-on assembly without relying on outsourced PCBs.
- Fits the project’s goal of being a personal, handmade effort.

**Impact:**
- Makes the initial hardware bigger and less compact.
- Will require a detailed wiring plan and efficient use of space.
- May face challenges with component stability.
